# Contributing

Please do! The requirements document is open for all to edit and comment. Issues on the repo will also be used to document discussions and history. There is also a #elm-language-server Slack channel.

* Add language server feature requests.
* Suggest references to similar discussions and language server work.
* Suggest and discuss project goal, plans, milestones++
* Discuss top-level implementation details to clarify any architecture and components and how the language server will relate to existing and new elm tools.

I will accept PR's, but I will also appreciate and accept any main collaborators to have full access to this repository.

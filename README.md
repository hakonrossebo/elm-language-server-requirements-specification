# Elm Language Server Requirements Specification

### Purpose
Elm needs a language server to support common editor tooling. This can greatly improve editor support and tooling features.

This repository and [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETeZeN17hqM4yui4iqBv1jwO8HryDZyel2kdcxTCGGA/edit?usp=sharing) describes the Elm Language Server (ElmLS). Elm Language Server designed to service IDEs and other tools for the [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/). It should offer an access point to compilation and APIs for getting information about a program.

This repository and Google Document is intended to help as a working document to collect and coordinate requirements and effort to implement the Elm Language Server.

There is also a separate Elm Slack channel #elm-language-server we can use for discussions and questions.

# Elm Language Server Requirements Specification

### Purpose
Elm needs a language server to support common editor tooling. This can greatly improve editor support and tooling features.

This repository and [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETeZeN17hqM4yui4iqBv1jwO8HryDZyel2kdcxTCGGA/edit?usp=sharing) describes the Elm Language Server (ElmLS). Elm Language Server designed to service IDEs and other tools for the [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/). It should offer an access point to compilation and APIs for getting information about a program.

This repository and Google Document is intended to help as a working document to collect and coordinate requirements and effort to implement the Elm Language Server.

I plan to have this document as a main working document, but that discussion is discussed in github issues in this repository and concluded here. The requirements are separated for functionality/architecture/technical etc, but we can work out this separation together.
I will accept PR's, but I will also appreciate and accept any main collaborators to have full access to this repository.
Please discuss strategy and how to work in this document here: [issue #2](../../issues/2)

[Google Docs document here: -feel free to edit and add suggestions / comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETeZeN17hqM4yui4iqBv1jwO8HryDZyel2kdcxTCGGA/edit?usp=sharing)

There is also a separate Elm Slack channel #elm-language-server we can use for discussions and questions.
